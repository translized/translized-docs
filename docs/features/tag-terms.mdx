Term Tags allow you to easily tag (mark) terms, based on your preferences (”to do”, “review” etc.), and simplify your team’s collaboration.

## Add Term Tags

💡 Only the Owner and Admin can create new Term Tags. Contributors don’t have access to Tags.

To create a new Term Tag, go to Settings on the left hand side, and under ‘Term Tags’, click ‘Add’.

Name the tag, add the color and you’re all set.

Once your tags have been created, you can easily tag your terms, by editing the term. You can add one or more tags to each term.
