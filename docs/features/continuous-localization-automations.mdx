# Continuous Localization Automations

Set of rules for complete automation of localization processes inside your project.

## Auto-Toggle Unverified

Translized will automatically toggle (mark) other language translations as **"Unverified"** whenever you update primary language translation.

:::tip
We recommend you have this feature enabled because it will most likely help you to track what translations are up to date and ready for facing your users.
:::

## Pre-Translations

With Pre-Translation feature, you can **automatically translate new keys into multiple languages** directly after importing your files to Translized.

- ### **From Language**
  - Language that you want to translate from. Usuallay it will be your primary language on project, since most likely you will have most terms already translated on your primary language.
- ### **To Languages**
  - Languages that you want your newly imported terms to be translated to. You can select as many languages as are on your project.
- ### **Translation Memory**
  - If this option is checked, Translized will perform search and check for already existing translations across all of your projects. You can check more details and how it works on [Translation Memory page](/docs/features/translation-memory).
- ### **Machine Translation**
  - If this options is checked, Translized will translate all newly imported terms with [Machine Translation](/docs/features/machine-translations). Note that if you don't have enough **machine translation characters**, terms will not be translated.

:::info
If both **Translation Memory** and **Machine Translation** are checked, Translized will first check for [Translation Memory](/docs/features/translation-memory) as it asumes that it will be more accurate translation if there is one. If there is no match found, Translized will perform [Machine Translation](/docs/features/machine-translations) to translate term on respective language.

## Imported Terms

Automation rules that will apply on **New** or **Updated** terms from your imported file.

- ### **Override existing translations**

  - This option will allow you to ovveride existing translations with imported terms. Checking this option will unlock **Updated Terms** option below.

  :::tip
  This option is useful to be unchecked if you want to set your localization flow in a way where you can only update term translations manually inside app or you have translators dedicated to specific languages and you don't want someone else accidentally to mess up translations with file import.
  :::

- ### **New Terms**
  - **Tags**
    - Set tags that you previously created in your project to new terms that are imported.
- ### **Updated Terms**

  - **Tags**
    - Set tags that you previously created in your project to terms that have been updated inside your imported file.
  - **Deleted Terms**

    - Toogle this option to delete all other translations for term that has been updated from your imported file.

    :::tip
    This option can be useful to completly be sure that other translations need to be updated as well.
