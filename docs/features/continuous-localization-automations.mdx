Set of rules for complete automation of localization processes inside your project.

## Auto-Toggle Unverified

Translized will automatically toggle (mark) other language translations as **"Unverified"** whenever you update primary language translation.

:::tip
We recommend having this feature enabled at all times as it helps you keep track of which translations are up-to-date, and which need additional review.
:::

## Pre-Translations

With Pre-Translation feature, you can **automatically translate new keys into multiple languages** directly after importing your files to Translized.

- ### **From Language**
  - Language you are translating from. This is usually the primary project language - because it already has all keys translated.
- ### **To Languages**
  - Language you want your newly imported keys to be translated to. You can select as many languages as there are on your project.
- ### **Translation Memory**
  - If this option is checked, Translized will perform search and check for already existing translations across all of your projects. You can check more details and how it works on [Translation Memory page](/docs/features/translation-memory).
- ### **Machine Translation**
  - If this options is checked, Translized will translate all newly imported keys with [Machine Translation](/docs/features/machine-translations). Note that if you don't have enough **machine translation characters**, keys will not be translated.

:::info
If both **Translation Memory** and **Machine Translation** are checked, Translized will first check for [Translation Memory](/docs/features/translation-memory) as it asumes that it will be more accurate translation if there is one. If there is no match found, Translized will perform [Machine Translation](/docs/features/machine-translations) to translate key on respective language.

## Imported Keys

Automation rules that will apply on **New** or **Updated** keys from your imported file.

- ### **Override existing translations**

  - This option will allow you to ovveride existing translations with imported keys. Checking this option will unlock **Updated Keys** option below.

  :::tip
  We recommend leaving this option unchecked, if you want to set a localization flow where key translations can only be updated manually within the app. Additionally, if you have a language-specific translator, you donâ€™t want to risk accidentally modifying the translations when importing a file.
  :::

- ### **New Keys**
  - **Tags**
    - Assign previously created tags to newly imported keys.
- ### **Updated Keys**

  - **Tags**
    - Assign previously created tags to keys which have been updated within your imported file.
  - **Deleted Keys**

    - Activate this option if you want to delete all other key translations for a key which has been updated in your imported file.

    :::tip
    We recommend using this option to ensure all other translations are updated.
