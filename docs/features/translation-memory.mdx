Translation Memory feature allows you to get suggestion for your language translations based on previous translations accross all of your projects.

## How it works ?

In order to give you best possible suggestions, Translized will crawl all your projecs to find identical translations and suggest them to you.

:::info Note
By using Translation Memory, you can avoid translating the same term twice, as weâ€™ll reuse the correct translation from a previously translated term.

## Automation Rule

Inside Translized [Continious Localization Automations](/docs/features/continuous-localization-automations), you can set **Translation Memory** inside **Pre-Translation** rule.

:::info Note
**With this option you can be sure that whenever you are importing new term via file import, Translized will check if you already have same translation across all of your projects and translate that term for you automatically.**
