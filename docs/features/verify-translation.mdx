To ensure your localization project is running smoothly, use the Verify option to indicate whether a Key translation has been verified or not.

:::tip
This is most commonly used when the primary language translation is updated - to mark all other translations as unverified, and ensure all translations match.

## How to verify translations?

To mark a translated key as verified, or unverified, go to the Languages tab. On the right hand side, next to the key translation, you’ll find the verify icon.

## Auto-toggle Unverified

You also have the option of automating the process. This will ensure each time you update the primary language translation, all other language translations are marked as ‘Unverified.
