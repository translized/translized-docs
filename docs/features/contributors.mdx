# Contributors

Translized has multiple user roles within projects, so you can easily collaborate and successfully translate your keys.

There are 3 different roles with different permission levels.

- **Owner**
- **Admin**
- **Contributor**

## Owner

Once you create a project, you are considered the Owner of that project, and no other user can share that role with you.

You can add other users as admins or contributors.

As the owner, you have the highest level of permission within Translized - meaning you can confiture all project settings, manage users and delete the project.

## Admin

As an admin, you have the second highest level of permission within Translized. You can access all configuration settings of a project, but are not able to delete it, or change billing settings.

## Contributor

Contributor is the lowest role available in Translized. As a Contributor, you can only view the languages youâ€™ve been added to, add translations, use machine translation and export files.
