# Strings

Within Translized, each pricing plan has a different number of strings available for your localization project.

## What are Strings?

Strings are a number of terms + translations. For example, a 100 terms translated into 2 languages = 300 strings.

**A string can contain as many words or sentences as you need**.

### Example of 2 strings within Translized.

## How many strings do I have in Translized?

Once you begin your Translized trial, you’ll have 50 000 strings.

After the 14-day free trial, you will be automatically switched to the Free Plan, which has 1 000 available strings, unless you decide to upgrade to one of the 4 other plans, that have a larger number of available strings.
