QA (Quality Assurance) checks is a feature that will automatically detect common errors, inconsistencies, and missmatches in translations for you.

That way you can assure consistency and a high quality of your translations.

You can fine tune QA checks from the settings page (Project -> Settings -> QA Checks tab) and adopt them to your needs.
