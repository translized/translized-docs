# Keys

Within Translized, each pricing plan has a different number of keys available for your localization project.

## What are “Keys”?

At its core, a “Key” represents a key in your project that needs translation. Think of it as a unique identifier for a specific piece of text, waiting to be translated into various languages.
Let's illustrate: Imagine a Financial app with the title “Available Cash”. In the app's source code, this might be tagged as “BalanceScreen.availableCash.title”. If you wish to translate this title into three languages, “BalanceScreen.availableCash.title” counts as just 1 key, irrespective of the number of translations for “Available Cash”.
While other platforms might bill based on translation counts, word counts, or a mix, we've chosen simplicity. With our "Keys" approach, you can easily gauge costs and scale your project across languages without diving into intricate estimates.
