Order translations from a professional translator or a native speaker within Translized. Weâ€™re using **[Gengo](https://gengo.com)** as the provider.

## Create Order

To order human translation, you need to go to **Human Translation** tab inside your project (App -> Project -> Human Translation).

There you will see two tabs:

- **Create Order** (tab where you will create your orders)
- **Order list** (tab where you can track your orders)

### Source Language

This option is source language that human translator will use to translate from.

:::tip
This should usually be primary language of your project.
:::

### Translate To

Language you want your translation in.

### Translation Quality

This option has two choices:

- **Native Speaker**
  - Native speaker that is doing translations for language that you selected to translate to.
- **Professional Translator**
  - Profesional translator for language that you selected to translate to.

:::tip
If you project doesn't have some specific terminology or doesn't require advanced phrases for translation, **Native Speaker** option should be fine for you. But if you have any doubt, you can always order **Professional Translator** to get the most profesional translations.
:::

### Translation Style

This option is to explain to human translator in what context you want your translations to be.

:::info
Don't worry, this is not only and final explanation of your project context. Most important notes for translator should be written inside **[Briefing](/docs/features/human-translations#briefing)**.
:::

Options are:

- Friendly
- Business
- Formal
- Informal

### Translation Purpose

This is just one more option to better discribe context of your project to translator.

### Briefing

Briefing that will be sent to translator before he starts translating. Any kind of note that you want translator to know, you should write here.

:::tip
**We advise you to write briefing as detailed as possible in order to get the best results.**
