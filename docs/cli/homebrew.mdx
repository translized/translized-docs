# Homebrew

Follow next steps to download and import localization files to your project.
Before start make sure you have **projectId** and **api-token**, which you can find in Project Statistics and Account/API Access.

To install translized-cli via Brew, simply use:

```shell
brew tap translized/translized
brew install translized-cli
```

### Usage

1. Open Terminal and navigate to root folder of your project.

   ```shell
   cd /path/to/project
   ```

2. Initialize your project by executing the `init` command. This lets you define your preferred locale file format, download, upload files and more.

   ```shell
   translized init
   ```

3. Use the upload command to `upload` your locale file from your defined sources:

   ```shell
   translized upload
   ```

4. Use the download command to `download` the most recent locale files back into your project:

   ```shell
   translized download
   ```
