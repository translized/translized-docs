# Download

Download your translation files by executing the `translized download` command.

You can add additional download options and setup workflow per your needs.

### Transform placeholders

Transform placeholders on download to native one's for iOS and android.

e.g. Android string with placeholders **I live in %1$s with %2$s for %3$.2f years.** will be exported as **I live in %@ with %@ for %.2f years.** on iOS

This allows you to share project between iOS and android and don't worry about platform specific placeholders.

### Replace empty translations

It is a common situation that translations are not ready while developing some feature, so when you change a language you can get screens with empty titles, labels, texts... 

Choose one of two download options and avoid empty screens on non-primary languages:

1. Replace empty with primary language translations 

2. Replace empty with pseudolocalized strings

  **This option is particular usefull if you wan't to test how UI looks when strings are longer than primary language**

  If selected `translized init` command will ask for increase percentage where you can input how much longer strings you want in percentage.

e.g. if you set 50 for increase_percentage: **Welcome to Translized!** will be exported like **Welcome to Translized!Welcome to ** in files for languages which are not yet translated.

:::info

**Only empty translations will be replaced!**
