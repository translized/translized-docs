```bash
translized upload
```

Set additional options for upload and download directly in configuration file:

- update_translation
- tags

### Update existing translations

If you have changed some existing translations and you want to update them on Translized too you can use this property.
It means that all existing translations for language you upload file will be updated with the translations from the file.
New keys and translations are added normally.

**Use this when you change translations directly in file and you want to sync it on platform**

Add this option to the configuration file under upload configuration:

```yml
:upload:
- :path: "./<locale_code>.json"
  :update_translations: true
```
