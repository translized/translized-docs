# Upload

Whenever you add new keys or change existing ones, you can upload them to the Translized app via the upload command:

```bash
translized upload
```

Set additional options for upload and download directly in the configuration file:

- update_translation
- tags

### Update existing translations

If you have changed some existing translations and you want to update them on Translized too you can use this property.
It means that all existing translations for the language you upload file will be updated with the translations from the file.
New keys and translations are added normally.

**Use this when you change translations directly in the file and you want to sync it on the platform**

Add this option to the configuration file under upload configuration:

```yml
:upload:
- :path: "./<locale_code>.json"
  :update_translations: true
```

### Tag all updated keys

If you have selected the option to update existing translations you can also use the option to tag all updated keys.
It means that a particular key will be tagged only if the translation changed.

:::info
**Only updated keys will be tagged and override existing translations must be true for this option to work**
:::

Add this option to the configuration file under upload configuration:

```yml
:upload:
- :path: "./<locale_code>.json"
  :update_translations: true
  :tags:
    :updated_keys: updated_1, updated_2
```

### Tag all new keys

You can use the option to tag all new keys.
This can help you organize keys around features, tickets, or screens.

:::info
**Only new keys will be tagged**
:::

Add this option to the configuration file under upload configuration:

```yml
:upload:
- :path: "./<locale_code>.json"
  :update_translations: true
  :tags:
    :new_keys: new_1, new_2
```

:::tip
**These options are optional and you don't need to use them**
