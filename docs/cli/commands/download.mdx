# Download

Download your translation files by executing the command:

```bash
translized download
```

You can add additional download options and setup workflow per your needs.

### Transform placeholders

Transform placeholders on download to native one's for iOS and android.

For example, Android string with placeholders:

_**I live in %1$s with %2$s for %3$.2f years.**_

on iOS will be exported as:

_**I live in %@ with %@ for %.2f years.**_

:::tip
**This allows you to share project between iOS and android and don't worry about platform specific placeholders.**
:::

### Replace empty translations

It is a common situation that translations are not ready while developing some feature, so when you change a language you can get screens with empty titles, labels, texts...

Choose one of two download options and avoid empty screens on non-primary languages:

- Replace empty with primary language translations
- Replace empty with pseudolocalized strings

:::tip
**Replace empty with pseudolocalized strings option is particular usefull if you wan't to test how UI looks when strings are longer than primary language.**

You can set length of pseudo translations. For example:

Setting value 50 as increased percentage, translation:

**Welcome to Translized !**

will be exported like:

**Welcome to Translized !Welcome to**

in files for languages which are not yet translated.
:::

:::info
**Only empty translations will be replaced!**
