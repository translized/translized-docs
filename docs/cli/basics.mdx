# Basics

Translized CLI allows you to easily download and upload localization files to your project, without leaving Terminal.
Integrate it in your CI/CD and be sure you always have latest translations in your build.

## Getting started

### Installation

Install CLI through [Brew](/docs/cli/homebrew) or add it Manually following Installation section

### CLI Initialization

To initialize CLI inside your project, from projects root directory execute the command:

```shell
translized init
```

It will create **.translized.yml** file where setup preferences will be stored.

:::tip
You can change .translized.yml file at anytime directly or by running `translized init` command again.
:::

Based on this file, Translized knows with which language you are working localy and will upload and download desired translations with the respective commands.

### Download Translations

To download your translation files from Translized app directly to your project run:

```shell
translized download
```

### Upload Translations

When you want to upload translations from your project to Translized app you need to run:

```shell
translized upload
```

:::info
You will upload language based on `.translized.yml` and setup that you did.
:::

:::tip
Usually you will work localy with primary language and will update that one, but ofcourse you can upload other languages as well, just be sure to specify them with **translized init** command.
:::

## Configuration YML file

After running `translized init` command, **.translized.yml** file will be created.
Setup preferences will be stored here and later you can change it directly or by running the command again.

You can add additional download options and setup workflow per your needs:

- transform placeholders on download so you can share one project for iOS and android
- replace empty translations with primary language translations or with pseudolocalized strings

Set additional options for upload and download directly in the configuration file:

- tags: Specify which tags to download or how to tag new or updated keys on upload. Provide as a comma-separated string
- update_translations: Specify should upload update existing translations.

File example:

```yml
