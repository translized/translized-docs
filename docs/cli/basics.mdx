# Basics

Translized CLI allows you to easily download and upload localization files to your project, without leaving Terminal.
Integrate it in your CI/CD and be sure you always have latest translations in your build.

### Getting started

1. Install CLI through [Brew](/docs/cli/homebrew) or add it Manually following Installation section

2. Initialize your project by executing the `translized init` command. This lets you define your preferred locale file format, download, upload files and more. 
It will create .translized.yml file where setup preferences will be stored. 
Later you can change it directly or by runing the command again.

3. Download your translation files by executing the `translized download` command.

4. Upload changed primary language file by executing the `translized upload` command whenever you add new keys or change existing.


### Configuration file 

After runing `translized init` command, .translized.yml file will be created.
Setup preferences will be stored here and later you can change it directly or by runing the command again.

You can add additional download options and setup workflow per your needs:
- transform placeholders on download so you can share one project for iOS and android
- replace empty translations with primary language translations or with pseudolocalized strings

You can pass additional options for upload command directly in terminal so you can have flexibility each time you upload:
- override existing translations
- tag all new keys
- tag all updated keys

File example:
