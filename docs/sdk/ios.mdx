You can also see instructions on our [GitHub](https://github.com/translized/iOS-SDK)

## Features

- Over-the-air (OTA) localization
- NSBundle swizzling for seamless integration

## Requirements

- Xcode 12+
- iOS 10.0+

## Setup

### Swift Package Manager

To install using [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/):

a. Add through `File -> Add Packages...` action in Xcode. Use https://github.com/translized/iOS-SDK repository URL and the Version: Up to Next Minor starting with 1.0.0 option.

b. Add this line to `dependencies` section of your `Package.swift`:

    .package(name: "Translized", url: "https://github.com/translized/iOS-SDK", .upToNextMinor(from: "1.0.0"))

### Manual (.xcframework)

To install **.xcframework** manually:

1. Download the [Zip archive](https://github.com/translized/iOS-SDK/archive/refs/tags/1.0.0.zip) containing the .xcframework, extract it, and add it to your project.
2. Add it to your targets (embed and link).

## Getting started

Before start make sure you have `projectId` and `otaToken`, which you can find in Project/Release and Account/API Access, and make a release on Translized Dashboard/Project/Release.

### Usage

**Configuring the SDK**
We recommend configuring Translized SDK within the AppDelegate function - `func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool`

    Translized.shared.setup(projectId: "Project ID", otaToken: "Ota token")
    Translized.shared.swizzleMainBundle()

**Checking for updates**

To get new translations you need to call the `checkForUpdates:` method. A good place for this is in the `applicationDidBecomeActive:` method of your App delegate. It will be called every time application is launched or restored from the background.

    func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
        Translized.shared.checkForUpdates { (updated, error) in
            print("Updated: \(updated)\nError: \(error)")
        }
    }

**Updating UI**

Translized posts the `TranslizedDidUpdateLocalization` notification when the localization files are updated. Subscribe to it in any view controller or model in order to react and update your UI.

    NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
            self,
            selector: #selector(translizedRefresh(_:)),
            name: Notification.Name.TranslizedDidUpdateLocalization,
            object: nil)

**Referring keys**

There is no need to update your code with swizzling enabled, refer to the keys as usual:

    NSLocalizedString("key", comment: "comment")
    NSLocalizedString("key", tableName: "tableName", comment: "comment")

If you have not enabled bundle swizzling, you can refer to the keys using the Translized SDK directly:

    Translized.shared.localisedString(key: "key", value: "default value", table: "tableName")
