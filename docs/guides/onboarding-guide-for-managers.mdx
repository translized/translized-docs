\*_Please note that the primary language you assign to this project can be changed later on in Project Settings._

<Aside>
  ðŸ’¡ You have no limitation as to how many projects you can create, and you can
  organize them as you wish.
</Aside>

Whether that be by platform, product or feature. Itâ€™s up to you, and Translized gives you all the flexibility you need.

This is what the project dashboard will look like once created.

## Import Keys

Once youâ€™ve created your project, itâ€™s time to add keys that need to be translated.

There are 2 ways to do that within Translized:

- Import a file
- Add keys manually

To import a file, visit the Import tab, placed under the Keys tab.

Translized accepts a huge variety of file formats you can import: _Microsof Excel (.xlsx), CSV (.csv), Android (.xml), iOS (.strings), Java (.properties), JSON (.json), Angular (.xlf), YAML (.yml) .NET (.resx), ARB (.arb), PHP (.php), PO (.po)._

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.07.14 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.07.14_AM.png)

To import a file, drag it into the import box or click on the â€˜+â€™ sign to upload it. You have the option to override existing translations, but since youâ€™re just starting out, you can leave this option blank.

Key tags can also be added on this step, but youâ€™ll first have to add them in Project Settings.

Once youâ€™re done and everything looks good, click on â€˜Import Fileâ€™ and youâ€™re done. You can now go to the Keys tab and youâ€™ll see that the keys have been added.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.08.14 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.08.14_AM.png)

Thereâ€™s also a possibility of manual key upload. On the Keys tab, in the right hand corner, thereâ€™s the option to add a key by clicking on â€˜Add keyâ€™.

Fill in the information and when youâ€™re ready, add the key. It will be added to the previously populated list of keys.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.08.50 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.08.50_AM.png)

## Invite Team Members

Once youâ€™ve successfully created your project and added the keys, you can now invite your team members to collaborate with you.

To do so, go back to Projects, and youâ€™ll notice the â€˜Contributorsâ€™ page, where you can add new Admins and Contributors.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.09.14 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.09.14_AM.png)

Because you are the one who created the project, you will remain the Owner of the project. Other team members wonâ€™t have the same permission level as you do, and you will remain the only person who can delete the project.

The Admin role will, beside the fact that they cannot delete the project, have all the permissions as you do.

The Contributor role will not be able to import or edit keys nor add new languages, order human translation and utilize the Over the Air feature.

When inviting an Admin, youâ€™ll need to choose the Role and Project. When inviting a Contributor, youâ€™ll have the added step of choosing the language(s) you want to add them to.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.09.41 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.09.41_AM.png)

Once the Admin and/or Contributor accept your invitation, theyâ€™ll be able to access your Project.

## Translate Keys

To start translating your keys, add an additional language, next to the primary language. You can add as many languages as you need.

By clicking on the â€˜Add languageâ€™ option on the right hand side, youâ€™ll be able to do so.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.10.13 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.10.13_AM.png)

Once you add your new language, the progress bar will be at 0% until you start adding your translations.

There are a few different ways you can translate your keys in Translized.

You can do it manually, by clicking on the language and adding translations for each key. This is most commonly used when working with a translator.

Translators have multiple options that can help them along the way, such as Translation History, Translation Memory and Machine Translation.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.11.20 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.11.20_AM.png)

As an Admin, you can also view previous changes made to the Key by utilizing Translation History.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.11.48 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.11.48_AM.png)

For more information about manual translation, visit _Translizedâ€™s Guide for Translators_.

Another option you have with Translized, is to translate the keys with the help of Machine Translation.

The Machine Translation tab is placed below the Export option in the left hand side menu. By default, youâ€™ll have 1000 characters at your disposal, but you can always purchase more through the app.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.12.42 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.12.42_AM.png)

Once you select the languages, click Translate, and your keys will automatically be translated.

Another way to translate keys in Translized is to order Human Translation. This is an option Contributors cannot access.

To order translation from a professional translator, visit the Human Translation tab, and enter the necessary information about the translation.

Youâ€™ll get an estimate on what the price of the translation will be. And you can always review your orders by visiting the tab â€˜Order Listâ€™ on top.

## Manage Keys

When on the Keys tab, you can easily edit each one by clicking on the three dots next to the key. On here, you can comment, edit the key or delete it.

If you want to edit the key, add context or key tags, you can do it from here. Please note that if you want to add a Key Tag, you must first create it in Project Settings.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.16.29 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.16.29_AM.png)

Additional option you have on this view is â€˜Quick translateâ€™ allowing you to translate the keys without going into individual languages.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.17.04 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.17.04_AM.png)

For full customization of the Key, you can click on the Key name, and a new page will open, giving you complete flexibility over the key.

On here, you have the added functionality of adding context screenshots that can help your translators translate the key in a more precise way.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.17.29 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.17.29_AM.png)

## Communication

We know how important communication is, thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve added additional benefits within Translized that can help you communicate with your team members with ease.

Each key has the option to leave comments with the additional functionality to mention team members. Weâ€™ll notify the user mentioned via email, so they can view your comment as soon as possible.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.18.00 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.18.00_AM.png)

Another way to communicate is through key tags which can be created in Project Settings.

To create a new Key Tag, click on â€˜Addâ€™ under Key Tags and add the color and the name.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.18.46 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.18.46_AM.png)

Once created, you can easily add them to certain keys, which can help your team members know what the status of each key is.

## Export Translation

Once your translation is ready, you can easily export it in the 12 file formats supported by Translized.

Visit the Export tab on the left hand side, select the file format and language you want, and youâ€™re good to go.

You have the additional option of adding a custom file name and replacing empty translations with primary language translation.

![Screen Shot 2022-06-28 at 2.19.18 AM.png](/guides/onboarding-guide-for-managers/Screen_Shot_2022-06-28_at_2.19.18_AM.png)
