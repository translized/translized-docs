# Import Localization Terms

Once youâ€™ve created your project, itâ€™s time to add terms that need to be translated.

Within Translized, this can be done in three different ways:

- Manually
- Translizedâ€™s CLI
- Over the Air (OTA) Mobile SDK

## Import terms manually (in bulk)

To import a file manually, visit the Import tab on the left hand side, and drag or drop your file into the designated space.

:::tip
File formats you can import:Â *Microsof Excel (.xlsx), CSV (.csv), Android (.xml), iOS (.strings), Java (.properties), JSON (.json), Angular (.xlf), YAML (.yml) .NET (.resx), ARB (.arb), PHP (.php), PO (.po).*
:::

Next, choose the language in which the terms have been translated.

Configure import with the following options:

- **Return obsolete terms:** Obsolete terms are those found in the project, but not in the imported file. You have the option to return all obsolete terms when importing a file - so you can keep, or delete them from your project.
- **Override Import Automations rules:** Disable previously set automation rules.

:::

- **Override existing translations:** Override existing term translations with the imported ones.

### Add a single term manually

Additionally, you can manually import a single term on the Terms page.

- **Term:** Term key.
- **Context:** Help your team members by providing additional context on where the term is being used.
- **Term tag:** Tag your newly imported term.

Once imported, youâ€™ll notice that your Terms page has been populated with the newly added terms.

## Import files using Translizedâ€™s CLI

Use our CLI and update localization with a single line from your terminal. Additionally, integrate CLI in your build process, and make sure you have the latest translations in every build.

## Use Over the Air (OTA) Mobile SDK

No more need to create a new release each time you want to make textual changes. Integrate our Mobile SDK and publish translation in real-time on App Store or Google Play.
