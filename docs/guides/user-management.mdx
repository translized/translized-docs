# User Management

Within Translized, you have 3 different roles with various permission levels.

- **Owner**
- **Admin**
- **Contributor**

## Manage Users

To manage users, visit the Contributors page on the left hand side, or quickly access by following this link: [https://app.translized.com/home/contributors](https://app.translized.com/home/contributors)

To add a new team member, click on â€˜Add Contributorâ€™.

- **Email:** add the userâ€™s email address.
- **Role:** select the role you want to assign to them - Contributor or Admin.
- **Language:** If youâ€™re adding a Contributor, youâ€™ll also specify which language(s) you want to add them to.

Once you input all the necessary information, a request will be sent to the user. Once they accept their invitation, theyâ€™ll join you on your project.

In the meantime, their invitation will be pending, and you can either revoke the invitation or edit permission levels.

You can easily navigate through the page by filtering the data by:

- **Project**
- **Language**
- **Or by searching for a specific contributor.**
