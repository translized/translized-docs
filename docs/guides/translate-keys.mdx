# Translate Keys

Once youâ€™ve successfully imported your keys, itâ€™s time to translate them.

:::tip

:::

There are 3 different ways of translating your keys:

- Manual Translation
- Machine Translation
- Human Translation

## Manual Translation

Through the Languages tab, you can focus on each language individually and translate one at a time.

This is what the tab will look like once you land on it. On the left hand side you can see the primary language, and on the right hand side you can add your translation.

To translate a key, all you have to do is add the translation in the text input field next to the key, and it will be automatically saved. Based on your progress, the progress bar will be updated.

Here are a few features that can help you along the way:

### Key Tags

Key tags are created by Project Admins to give more context about each Key (for example: to do, needs review). Key tags can be found next to the Key youâ€™re translating.

### Translation Memory

Translation Memory helps you reuse text you've already translated, so you do not have to translate the same text multiple times. This option can be found next to the text input field.

### Translation History

Translation history gives you a full overview of all version changes, and allows you to revert to the previous translation version in a click. Translation history can be found by clicking on the 3 dots on the right hand side.

### Machine Translation

If you need additional help translating, you can utilize the power of machine translation on each key. To reveal this option, click on the 3 dots on the right hand side.

### Mark as verified

You also have the option of marking your translation as â€˜verifiedâ€™ or â€˜unverifiedâ€™.

## Quick Translate

In case you want to review translations for multiple languages, or are looking for a way to quickly update translations for each language, you can use the Keys tab.

On the right hand side of each Key, you have the option for Quick Translate. Once you click on it, a tab will open with all translations which you can then easily review or update.

:::info Note
Please note that if you are added as a Contributor to only one language, that is the only language you will be able to view in both Languages and Keys.
:::

## Key Overview

You have the option to view and update each Key individually as well. To enter this view, click on the Key you want (you can access this view from both Languages and Keys tabs).

This is what you will land on once you click on a specific key.

In addition to reviewing and updating the translations from here, you also have the option to add contextual screenshots. If the screenshot has been previously added by another team member, you will be able to view it here.

## Key Communication

In order to easily collaborate with your team members, there are a few different options within each key.

### Comments

Each Key can be commented on, so you can update your team members of what the status is, or ask for feedback/questions. Additionally, you can add comments to provide further guidance for other team members.

### Mentions

Mention other team members in comments for faster and easier collaboration. Once you mention a team member, they will receive an email informing them of your comment so they can view it as soon as possible.

### Key Tags

Key tags are added by Admins, and can provide additional guidance for certain Keys.

### Screenshots

Screenshots are a great way to offer additional guidance on where a certain Key will be used, and help with translations.
