Once youâ€™ve created your project, itâ€™s time to add keys that need to be translated.

Within Translized, this can be done in three different ways:

- Manually
- Translizedâ€™s CLI

## Import keys manually (in bulk)

To import a file manually, visit the Import tab on the left hand side, and drag or drop your file into the designated space.

:::tip
File formats you can import:Â *Microsof Excel (.xlsx), CSV (.csv), Android (.xml), iOS (.strings), Java (.properties), JSON (.json), Angular (.xlf), YAML (.yml) .NET (.resx), ARB (.arb), PHP (.php), PO (.po).*
:::

Next, choose the language in which the keys have been translated.

Configure import with the following options:

- **Return obsolete keys:** Obsolete keys are those found in the project, but not in the imported file. You have the option to return all obsolete keys when importing a file - so you can keep, or delete them from your project.
- **Override Import Automations rules:** Disable previously set automation rules.

:::

- **Override existing translations:** Override existing key translations with the imported ones.

### Add a single key manually

Additionally, you can manually import a single key on the Keys page.

- **Key:** Key key.
- **Context:** Help your team members by providing additional context on where the key is being used.
- **Key tag:** Tag your newly imported key.

Once imported, youâ€™ll notice that your Keys page has been populated with the newly added keys.

## Import files using Translizedâ€™s CLI

Use our CLI and update localization with a single line from your terminal. Additionally, integrate CLI in your build process, and make sure you have the latest translations in every build.
