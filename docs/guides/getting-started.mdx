## Add your first project

After verifying your email, go ahead and [log in](https://app.translized.com/login) with the credentials you provided during signup.

To add a new project, provide the following information:

- **Name:** add your projectâ€™s name.
- **Primary language:** select your projectâ€™s primary (source) language. \*_This can be changed later on in Settings._

## Add Keys

Once youâ€™ve created your project, itâ€™s time to add keys that need to be translated.

Within Translized, this can be done in three different ways:

- Manually Add Keys
- Import Keys from a file
- Translizedâ€™s CLI

### Manually Add Keys

Manually add keys by going to **"Keys" tab** inside your project, a clicking **"Add Key"** button.

### Import Keys from a file

To import keys manually use the Import tab, and easily drag or drop the file to the designated field.

![Screen_Shot_2022-08-14_at_10.20_1.png](/guides/getting-started/Screen_Shot_2022-08-14_at_10.20_1.png)

Additionally, you can import keys one by one on the Key page.

### Import files using Translizedâ€™s CLI

Use our CLI and update localization with a single line from your terminal. Additionally, integrate CLI in your build process, and make sure you have the latest translations in every build.

## Add new languages

After youâ€™ve successfully added your keys, itâ€™s time to add languages.

![Screen_Shot_2022-08-14_at_11.20_1.png](/guides/getting-started/Screen_Shot_2022-08-14_at_11.20_1.png)

From our pre-populated list of languages, choose the one you want to translate your keys to.

## Change the primary language

If you want to change the primary language of your project, you can do so on the Settings page.

![/guides/getting-started/Screen_Shot_2022-08-14_at_11.24_1.png](/guides/getting-started/Screen_Shot_2022-08-14_at_11.24_1.png)

Once you add additional languages to your project, you can easily change the primary language by selecting the one you want from the dropdown menu.

## Translate keys

Everything is set up - and youâ€™re ready to start translating your keys. ðŸŽ‰

Translized offers 3 different ways of translating your keys:

- Manual Translation
- Machine Translation
- Human Translation

Regardless of the method you choose to use, youâ€™ll first need to add a language, in addition to the primary language

![/guides/getting-started/Screen_Shot_2022-08-15_at_11.57_1.png](/guides/getting-started/Screen_Shot_2022-08-15_at_11.57_1.png)

## Manual Translation

Manual translation is mostly used if youâ€™re translating the keys yourself, or are working with a translator.

There are 2 different ways to manually translate your keys: **per language**, and **per key**.

To translate **per language**, select the language you want, and you can easily start translating the keys one by one, with the help of additional tools provided by Translized.

![/guides/getting-started/Screen_Shot_2022-08-14_at_11.40_1.png](/guides/getting-started/Screen_Shot_2022-08-14_at_11.40_1.png)

To translate **per key**, go to the Keys page, select the key you want to translate, and do so with the help of Quick Translate, or on the key tab.

This option allows you to add translations for multiple languages at once.

## Automate your localization workflow

Set rules for complete automation of localization processes inside your project.

- **Auto-toggle Unverified**: Once you update the primary language translations, Translized will automatically mark other language translations as â€˜Unverifiedâ€™.
- **Pre-Translation**: Automatically translate new keys into multiple languages directly after importing your files to Translized.
- **Imported Keys**: Define actions on new or updated keys from your imported files.

## Export translations

Once youâ€™re all done - itâ€™s time to export your translations! ðŸš€

Visit the Export page, select the file format you want to export your translations in, choose the language you want to export, and youâ€™re all done.

![/guides/getting-started/Screen_Shot_2022-08-15_at_12.18_1.png](/guides/getting-started/Screen_Shot_2022-08-15_at_12.18_1.png)

And lastly, you can choose some of the advanced options offered by Translized, to additionally configure your export file.

- **Custom file name:** <locale_code> will be replaced with the language code of the selected language and <file_type> will be replaced with the file type of the selected file.
- **Empty translations:** Choose how you want to export empty translation - as empty strings, pseudo localization or replace with primary language translation.

Once you sign up for Translized, youâ€™ll start your 7-day free trial, which includes 8,000 keys and unlimited projects.
