# Webhooks

Integrate your custom webhooks with Translized and respond to all events occuring inside app.

## Setup

In order to setup webohook only thing you need is **Webhook URL**.

:::info
**Webhook URL** is endpoint that Translized will ping when selected event occurs.
:::

In order for your **Webhook URL** to verify that Translized is sending request, you will be provided with generated **Webhook Secret** which you should keep secretly inside your code.

If you feel that your **Webhook Secret** is compromised, you can always generate new one.
